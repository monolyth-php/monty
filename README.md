# monolyth/monty
The "full Monty" Monolyth installer! This installs all Composer packages you'll
_typically_ want for a full-blown Monolyth project.

## Installation/usage
```sh
composer require monolyth/monty
```

Ehm... that's all, really. You might also want to look at the suggestions we've
added to the `composer.json` file.
